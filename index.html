				<h1 class="howiwork" >How I work</h1>
					<p class="howiworkp">Before I start rambling on different techniques and software programs I like to use and what not, let me introduce myself, I'm Samuel Gipson and my career goal is to become a front end web developer. I have switched my career path so many times in my college career that it wasn't until my junior year that I found my passion.</p>

			<div id="good">
				<h2 class="good">The Good</h2>
					<p class="goodp">On a typical day I start with getting a little exercise and a good breakfast, otherwise I feel that I spend longer amounts of time on my homework because my brain feels like mush.  So given that I have started my day with a fresh start I start with homework.  Depending on how long it takes I try to finish it in time so that I can work on other projects for hobbies like Code Academy or Treehouse. I find that with a great schedule to plan out your priorities the efficiency is unmatched!</p>

			<div id="bad">
				<h2 class="bad">The Bad</h2>
					<p class="badp" >Well it seems as though I stayed up a little late last night, which I try not to do because my next day is that much shorter.  I awake some hours past my usual time and skip my workout routine in order to ketch up on homework.  After spending a few hours on homework I realize I forgot to eat breakfast.  That's probably why it took me 3 hours to do the homework in the first place, that and not exercising. Now I'm eating breakfast, well that is if you call chips breakfast at one in the afternoon.  However I'm behind and need to catch up!  At the end of the day I'm exhausted from turning my mind to goo from the homework, that I don't have the effort to put into Code Academy or Treehouse. This was not my best day.</p>

			<div id="ugly">
				<h2 class="ugly">The Ugly</h2>
					<p class="uglyp" >Well I'm sure you can guess how this day goes. I awake in a daze thinking it's 10am only to realize the clock says 1pm.  Well I guess I shouldn't have stayed up until 3am watching Game of Thrones while playing StarCraft 2.  I probably also shouldn't of had a whole Dominoes pizza to myself along with whatever else I could get my hands on at 3 in the morning.  I get out of bed, go over to the kitchen to find the mess I didn't feel like cleaning before.  After cleaning and eating some brunch it is now 2:30pm and my day is passing right by me.  Of course I also forgot about the 8 page paper due tonight, probably a side effect of Game of Thrones. I forget the side projects for the day and end up working on the paper until late in the night, leading to a bad day tomorrow.</p>

				<p id="asusp">I use a second monitor because I find that when I'm on my computer, regardless of what I'm doing I'm usually trying to do multiple tasks at once.  I use an Asus 22" monitor and let me tell you it makes all the difference on irritation and saving me time.  Instead of having to switch between tabs I have Live Reload setup on the other screen through Chrome so that every time I save it refreshes my code in the browser for me. This is probably my most favorite feature of Sublime Text 2.  I would be using the 3rd one if it had this feature.  Hopefully they update it quickly!</p>

				<p id="macp">I got my MacBook Pro before coming to college so it's an early 2011 series.  Since you have to drop a little over $2000 for one of these I went with the bare minimum and have kept it this way up until about 1 week ago when I upgraded the memory from 4gp of ram to a full 16gb of ram.  Now when working with adobe products I can easily run multiple programs at a time without it constantly freezing.  Before I got this MacPook Pro I was pro PC all the way.  I was also completely against Apple because I thought they were overpriced.  However over the years of using it and what I've learned about user experience design as well as the flawless ways in which this system works I can honestly say it's worth every penny.</p>

				<p id="logitechp">I couldn't stand reaching over my desk to work on things, especially after getting my new monitor, so I had to cave and buy a wireless keyboard.  This was a steal on black Friday for $30 when the original price was around $90.  I can now lean back and use my MacBook Pro strictly as another monitor and work in a nice comfortable setting where I'm not getting sore numb arms from leaning and sitting awkwardly.  I love it so much that I even sometimes use it while working on a couch.  I just set the macbook on a table and work from a distance.</p>
